# React Task Manger 
### Application Principles
- A better JavaScript ES6 syntax ( arrow functions, ternary operators, object destructuring and others! )
- React ( Presentational and Container Components )
- Redux ( State Management with our action creators, reducers, and store )
- Redux persist ( A great tool to persist and rehydrate redux store )
- Ant Design for a better UX & UI with Responsive Web Design
- LESS ( using less into your application makes style management easy )
